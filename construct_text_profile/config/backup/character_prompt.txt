# User Persona Analysis Task

## Objective
The primary goal of this task is to analyze user utterances in depth and accurately extract key persona attributes based on both direct and implicit cues. These attributes should be categorized into distinct fields, with any missing or unclear details left blank. Each extracted detail should be as specific as possible, reflecting the user's identity, context, and goals.

## Output Format
The extraction should be presented in a structured JSON format, as shown below. 

```json
{
    "gender": [],
    "age": [],
    "location": [],
    "occupation": [],
    "education": [],
    "family_relationships": [],
    "routines_or_habits": [],
    "goals_or_plans": [],
    "social_relationships": [],
    "language_style": [],
    "task_details":[],
    "other_experiences": []
}
```

## Field Descriptions
1. **gender**: The persona's gender identity (e.g., male, female, non-binary), as explicitly stated or implied.
2. **age**: Estimates of the user's age range based on linguistic patterns, life experiences, or generational knowledge
3. **location**: The persona's geographic area (e.g., country, city) inferred from place names, dialects, or cultural clues.
4. **occupation**:  The personaâ€™s current or past job, including industry, career trajectories, role, and professional experience.
5. **education**: The educational background of the persona, e.g. highest level of education achieved, fields of study, or significant academic references.
6. **family_relationships**: Connections with family members, including roles, dynamics, or interactions.
7. **routines_or_habits**: Regular routines, hobbies, or lifestyle practices
8. **goals_or_plans**: Short-term or long-term objectives; if not explicitly stated, infer from the main conversation topic
9. **task_details**: A concise summary of the specific task the user is requesting or asking about, focusing on the core objective.
10. **social_relationships**: Relationships with non-family members (e.g., friends, colleagues, social groups)
11. **language_style**: The persona's communication formality, tone, and distinctive expressions (e.g., politeness markers, idiomatic phrases).
12. **other_experiences**: Any unique life experiences, personal beliefs, or traits not covered by the other fields, such as significant life events, challenges, or values.


## Guidelines
1. Carefully examine each user utterance to extract relevant persona traits. Consider both direct statements and implicit clues.
2. Ensure that the extracted attributes are specific and directly relevant to the user's utterances. Avoid vague or generalized descriptions unless explicitly supported by the text.
3. For the "goals_or_plans" field, if not explicitly mentioned, infer based on the main topic. Be specific and align your interpretation with the primary topic of discussion.
4. Pay attention to distinctive communication styles (e.g., formal or casual tone, frequent use of specific words or phrases) to capture the user's unique way of communicating.
5. For multi-context conversations, analyze and categorize the speaker's attributes, intentions, and plans according to each distinct topic or situation being discussed.
6. In task scenarios involving a natural language instruction and input text, summarize the core objective of the input and present it in the "task_details" field.
