**Task:**  
Analyze the provided dialogue to assess the user’s personality traits across 5 personality dimensions. Focus exclusively on the user’s characteristics, disregarding any information related to other individuals, unless it directly impacts the user.

For each personality trait:

3. Provide **reason**: Justify the assigned score with specific evidence from the dialogue.

**Example:**  
```dialogue
[Assistant]: That’s what I’m here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Can you tell me more about your cousin?
[User]: "She is my age, in a homeless women’s shelter, living under very poor conditions. She is a mental health client, but the treatment team seems to believe that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and possibly has borderline personality disorder. Her background is similar to mine, and I cannot abandon her."
